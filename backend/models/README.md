# Data Models

This folder contains all the data models used in the project. Each data model is defined in a separate file using the Pydantic library. Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python, which uses Python type annotations to validate and parse data.

By organizing the data models in separate files, we maintain a clean and modular structure, making it easier to manage and update the models as needed.
