# Data Access Layer (DAL)

This is the Data Access Layer (DAL) for the StarWars backend application. The DAL is responsible for separating the data access logic from the business logic, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

- **Separation of Concerns**: By isolating the data access logic, the DAL helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns within the application.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the data access logic can be made independently of the business logic, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
